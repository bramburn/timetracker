Version: 1.9

Date: June 14, 2025

Author: Gemini

Status: Draft

### 1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the product requirements for a new time-tracking
application. The vision is to create a robust, efficient, and
user-friendly tool for monitoring employee productivity, particularly in
a remote or multi-user environment. The application will accurately
track user activity, provide insightful analytics, and seamlessly
integrate with a central server for data storage and analysis.

The chosen technology stack of C++/Qt6 for the client, .NET Web API for
the server, and Angular for the web frontend will enable a
high-performance desktop application with a powerful, scalable backend
and a modern, responsive web dashboard.

### 2. Problem Statement

Organizations, especially those with remote employees or those utilizing
shared server environments (like Windows Server), lack an effective and
unobtrusive way to monitor employee productivity. Existing solutions can
be overly complex, resource-intensive, or lack the specific features
needed for multi-user session tracking. This project aims to solve this
by providing a lightweight, yet powerful, time-tracking tool that offers
detailed insights into user activity without disrupting workflows.

### 3. Target Audience

The primary users of this application are:

- **System Administrators:** Who need to deploy, manage, and monitor the
  application across multiple users and machines.

- **Managers/Team Leads (Staff Admins):** Who require insights into team
  productivity, project progress, and resource allocation.

- **Employees/End-Users (Workers):** Who will use the application to
  track their work and, in some cases, manually categorize their time.

### 4. Goals & Objectives

- **Business Goal:** To improve team productivity and accountability
  through accurate time and activity tracking.

- **Product Goal:** To deliver a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly
  time-tracking application that meets the specific needs of our
  organization.

- **Technical Goal:** To build a scalable and maintainable application
  using C++/Qt6, .NET Web API, and Angular within a monorepo structure.

### 5. Features & Functionality (MVP)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on the core features
required for effective time tracking:

from the system tray, with options to show/hide the main window and exit
the application. \| High \|

\| F-07 \| Remote Desktop Session Support \| The application will
correctly identify and track individual user sessions in a multi-user
Windows Server environment. \| High \|

\| F-08 \| User Identification \| Users will be identified by their
email address, with no separate login credentials required for the
desktop client. \| Medium \|

\| F-09 \| Idle Time Detection \| The application will detect periods of
user inactivity and allow for manual categorization of that time. \|

### 7. Phased Development Plan

The project will be developed in three phases, with each phase broken
down into epics and sprints.

#### **Phase 1: Core Functionality & MVP (Estimated Duration: 7 Weeks)**

**Goal:** To build and deploy the Minimum Viable Product with all
essential tracking features.

**Epics:**

1.  **Client Application Setup:**

    - **Sprint 1: Foundational Window and Tray Setup**

      - **Tasks:** Initialize the C++/Qt6 project, create a basic
        QMainWindow, implement QSystemTrayIcon with a context menu
        (\"Show/Hide\", \"Quit\").

      - **Acceptance Criteria:** The application runs, showing a main
        window and a functional system tray icon.

    - **Sprint 2: Implemented \"Minimize to Tray\" Functionality**

      - **Tasks:** Subclass QMainWindow, override closeEvent to hide the
        window and ignore the event, preventing the app from closing.

      - **Acceptance Criteria:** Clicking the main window\'s close
        button hides the window. The application remains active.

2.  **Core Tracking Implementation:**

    - **Sprint 3: Proof-of-Concept: Activity Logging to File**

      - **Tasks:**

        - Implement basic low-level keyboard and mouse hooks using the
          Windows API (SetWindowsHookEx).

        - For every event detected (e.g., a key press or mouse click),
          write a simple, timestamped log entry to a local text file
          (e.g., activity_log.txt).

        - This implementation does not need to be threaded or optimized
          at this stage; its purpose is purely to validate the hook
          mechanism.

      - **Acceptance Criteria:** When the application is running, a
        local log file is created and populated with timestamped entries
        for each keyboard and mouse event, proving the core capture
        mechanism works.

    - **Sprint 4: Background Input Activity Tracking**

      - **Tasks:** Refactor the proof-of-concept from Sprint 3. Run the
        hook callbacks in a separate, non-GUI thread (QThread) to
        prevent freezing the main application. Aggregate input events
        over a defined time period (e.g., 1 minute) to create a simple
        \"activity level\" metric (e.g., number of clicks + keystrokes).

      - **Acceptance Criteria:** The application correctly captures
        keyboard and mouse activity system-wide, even when minimized.
        The activity is quantified into a periodic metric without
        impacting UI responsiveness.

    - **Sprint 5: Screenshot Capture Functionality**

      - **Tasks:** Use a QTimer to trigger screen captures via Windows
        GDI, compress to JPEG, and save locally.

      - **Acceptance Criteria:** The application automatically takes and
        saves screenshots at a configured frequency.

    - **Sprint 6: Active Application Tracking**

      - **Tasks:** Use a QTimer and Windows API (GetForegroundWindow,
        etc.) to identify and log the active application name and window
        title.

      - **Acceptance Criteria:** The application accurately logs the
        active application at regular intervals.

3.  **Server Communication:**

    - **Sprint 7: Backend API and Data Ingestion Pipeline**

      - **Tasks:** Define backend data models and API endpoints for
        activity/screenshots. Implement screenshot upload service to
        process images (create thumbnail) and upload both versions to
        AWS S3, storing URLs in PostgreSQL. Implement client-side HTTP
        service (QNetworkAccessManager) to send batched data and upload
        screenshots.

      - **Acceptance Criteria:** The backend API correctly ingests and
        stores all data. The client successfully transmits data and
        cleans up local files upon confirmation.

#### **Phase 2: Business Logic & Administration (Estimated Duration: 8 Weeks)**
