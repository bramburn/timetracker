# Implementation Guide for Employee Activity Monitor System

This comprehensive analysis examines the technical implementation requirements for the Employee Activity Monitor system outlined in the provided Product Requirements Document. The system represents a sophisticated workplace monitoring solution that captures user activity data through background processes, requiring careful integration of Windows APIs, database management, and network communication technologies.

## Core Technical Architecture and Implementation Strategy

The Employee Activity Monitor system follows a phased development approach, beginning with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that establishes fundamental monitoring capabilities[^1_1]. The architecture centers around a C\# .NET Windows application that operates silently in the background, leveraging Windows APIs for system-level data capture and SQLite for local data persistence[^1_1].

The implementation strategy requires a multi-layered approach combining low-level Windows API integration, robust data management, and secure network communication. The system must maintain minimal resource footprint while ensuring reliable data capture across diverse Windows environments. The architectural foundation supports future expansion through modular design, allowing for enhanced features like screenshot capture, centralized reporting, and advanced analytics in subsequent phases[^1_1].

## Essential Windows APIs and System Integration

### Window Tracking and Process Monitoring

The core functionality relies on several critical Windows APIs for active window detection and process identification. The `GetForegroundWindow()` function serves as the primary mechanism for retrieving handles to the currently active window[^1_2][^1_13][^1_18][^1_20]. This API returns an `IntPtr` representing the window handle, which forms the foundation for all subsequent window-related operations[^1_2].

Window title extraction requires the `GetWindowText()` function, which copies the title bar text of specified windows into a buffer[^1_3][^1_13]. The implementation must handle proper buffer allocation and null-terminated string management to ensure reliable text capture[^1_3]. Process identification utilizes `GetWindowThreadProcessId()` to retrieve both thread and process identifiers associated with specific window handles[^1_12][^1_13]. This combination enables the system to associate window activity with specific applications and processes.

The `GetWindowTextLength()` function provides essential support for dynamic buffer allocation, ensuring optimal memory usage when capturing window titles of varying lengths[^1_14]. These APIs work together to create a comprehensive window monitoring system that can accurately track user application usage patterns.

### Global Input Hook Implementation

Activity detection requires sophisticated global hook mechanisms to monitor keyboard and mouse input across all applications. The system employs `SetWindowsHookEx()` with `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` and `WH_MOUSE_LL` parameters to establish low-level input hooks[^1_5][^1_6][^1_7][^1_15][^1_19]. These hooks enable system-wide input monitoring without requiring focus on the monitoring application.

Keyboard hook implementation involves creating a `LowLevelKeyboardProc` callback function that processes keyboard events before they reach target applications[^1_5][^1_15][^1_19]. The callback must execute efficiently to avoid system performance degradation, as Windows forwards all keyboard events through the monitoring application[^1_7]. Mouse hook implementation follows similar patterns, capturing mouse movement, clicks, and other mouse-related events[^1_7][^1_15].

Critical considerations include hook stability and proper resource management. Global hooks can cause system instability if not implemented correctly, requiring careful error handling and proper cleanup procedures[^1_5][^1_6]. The implementation must also address potential conflicts with security software that may flag global hooks as suspicious behavior[^1_19].

## Database Management and Data Storage

### SQLite Integration and Schema Design

Local data storage utilizes SQLite through either `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` or `System.Data.SQLite` libraries, with Microsoft's implementation recommended for modern .NET applications[^1_8][^1_9][^1_16]. The database schema must accommodate the core data points specified in the requirements: timestamp, Windows username, active window title, application process name, and activity status[^1_1].

Table design should prioritize efficient querying and future expansion capabilities. The primary activity log table requires proper indexing on timestamp and username fields to support rapid data retrieval and analysis[^1_16]. Additional tables may be necessary for configuration data, error logging, and system metadata. The schema must also accommodate data type considerations for Unicode text support and timestamp precision[^1_9].

Connection management requires implementing proper disposal patterns and connection pooling to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization[^1_8][^1_16]. The implementation should include database creation routines that automatically establish the required schema on first run, ensuring seamless deployment across target systems.

### Data Persistence and Transaction Management

Reliable data capture necessitates robust transaction management to prevent data loss during system interruptions or application crashes[^1_16]. The implementation should batch database operations to minimize I/O overhead while ensuring data integrity through proper transaction boundaries. Error handling mechanisms must gracefully manage database connection failures, disk space limitations, and concurrent access scenarios.

Data retention policies require implementing automated cleanup procedures to manage database size growth over time[^1_1]. The system should provide configurable retention periods and archival mechanisms to balance storage requirements with historical data preservation needs. Backup and recovery procedures ensure data protection against hardware failures or system corruption.

## Network Communication and Data Transmission

### HTTP Client Implementation and JSON Handling

Data transmission to external endpoints requires robust HTTP client implementation using `System.Net.Http.HttpClient`[^1_10][^1_17]. The system must serialize captured data into JSON format for transmission to the configured Pipedream endpoint during the MVP phase[^1_1]. JSON serialization utilizes `System.Text.Json` for modern .NET applications, providing efficient serialization and deserialization capabilities[^1_10][^1_17].

HTTP communication must include proper error handling for network failures, timeout scenarios, and server unavailability[^1_1]. The implementation should implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to handle transient network issues without overwhelming target endpoints. SSL/TLS support ensures encrypted data transmission, protecting sensitive activity information during network transit[^1_1].

Configuration management enables dynamic endpoint specification through application settings files, allowing deployment flexibility without code modifications[^1_11]. The HTTP client implementation must support various authentication mechanisms and custom headers as required by target endpoints.

### Resilient Data Queuing and Retry Logic

Network unreliability necessitates implementing local data queuing mechanisms that store unsent data during connectivity issues[^1_1]. The queue implementation should persist pending data to disk to survive application restarts and system reboots. Priority queuing may be necessary to ensure critical data transmission while managing bandwidth limitations.

Retry logic must implement intelligent backoff strategies to avoid overwhelming failed endpoints while ensuring eventual data delivery[^1_1]. The system should log transmission failures for administrative review and provide mechanisms for manual data resubmission when automated retry attempts fail. Queue size management prevents excessive disk usage during extended connectivity outages.

## Development Tools and Resource Requirements

### Development Environment and Dependencies

The implementation requires Visual Studio or similar .NET development environment supporting C\# .NET Framework or .NET Core development[^1_1][^1_4]. NuGet package management facilitates dependency installation for SQLite drivers, HTTP client libraries, and JSON serialization components[^1_8][^1_9]. The development environment must support Windows API P/Invoke declarations and unsafe code compilation for low-level system integration.

Required NuGet packages include Microsoft.Data.Sqlite for database operations, System.Net.Http for network communication, and Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration for application settings management[^1_8][^1_9][^1_10][^1_11]. Additional packages may be necessary for logging frameworks, unit testing, and deployment automation.

### Deployment and Installation Infrastructure

Application deployment requires creating Windows Installer packages (MSI) or setup executables for administrative installation[^1_1]. The installer must handle service registration for background operation, registry modifications for startup configuration, and proper file placement in system directories. Digital code signing ensures system acceptance and reduces security warnings during installation.

Deployment infrastructure should support silent installation for enterprise environments and group policy deployment mechanisms[^1_1]. The installation process must create necessary database files, establish proper file permissions, and configure Windows service registration for automatic startup. Uninstallation procedures must completely remove all system modifications and data files.

## Security Considerations and Privacy Implementation

### Data Protection and Access Control

Security implementation requires encrypting sensitive data both in transit and at rest[^1_1]. Database encryption protects locally stored activity data from unauthorized access, while HTTPS communication secures network transmission. Access control mechanisms prevent unauthorized application modification or data extraction by non-administrative users[^1_1].

The application must resist tampering attempts through code obfuscation and integrity checking mechanisms[^1_1]. Administrative privilege requirements for installation and configuration prevent unauthorized deployment or modification. Regular security audits and penetration testing ensure ongoing protection against emerging threats.

### Privacy Compliance and Ethical Monitoring

Privacy implementation requires careful balance between monitoring requirements and employee privacy rights[^1_1]. The system must avoid capturing sensitive information like actual keystroke content, focusing instead on activity metrics and application usage patterns[^1_1]. Transparent data collection practices and clear privacy policies ensure compliance with applicable regulations and organizational policies.

Data minimization principles guide implementation decisions, capturing only information necessary for stated objectives[^1_1]. Consent mechanisms and employee notification procedures ensure awareness of monitoring activities and compliance with legal requirements. Regular privacy impact assessments evaluate ongoing compliance with evolving privacy regulations and organizational policies.

## Performance Optimization and System Integration

### Resource Management and Performance Monitoring

The application must maintain minimal system impact, targeting less than 5% CPU usage and under 100MB RAM consumption[^1_1]. Performance optimization requires efficient algorithm implementation, proper memory management, and optimized database queries. Regular performance monitoring identifies resource usage patterns and potential optimization opportunities.

Global hook implementation requires particular attention to performance impact, as inefficient hook procedures can significantly degrade system responsiveness[^1_7]. The monitoring application must process hook events rapidly and avoid blocking system operations. Background thread management ensures monitoring operations don't interfere with primary application performance.

## Future Expansion and Scalability Considerations

### Modular Architecture for Phase Development

The implementation architecture must support the planned phase development approach, enabling seamless integration of enhanced features like screenshot capture, web-based reporting, and advanced analytics[^1_1]. Modular design patterns facilitate feature addition without disrupting core monitoring functionality. Plugin architectures may support optional feature deployment based on organizational requirements.

Scalability planning addresses future requirements for centralized data collection and multi-user reporting systems[^1_1]. The local database schema and API design must accommodate future integration with centralized servers and web-based administration interfaces. Data export capabilities enable migration to enhanced systems as the organization's monitoring needs evolve.

## Conclusion

Implementing the Employee Activity Monitor requires sophisticated integration of Windows APIs, database management, and network communication technologies. Success depends on careful attention to performance optimization, security implementation, and privacy compliance while maintaining the flexibility to support future enhancement phases. The technical complexity demands experienced .NET developers familiar with Windows system programming and enterprise application deployment practices.

The comprehensive nature of this system necessitates thorough testing across diverse Windows environments and careful consideration of organizational policies and legal requirements. Proper implementation of this monitoring system can provide valuable insights into workplace productivity patterns while maintaining appropriate respect for employee privacy and system security.

# can i setup a c\# project from visual studio or visual studio code or can I use rider from jetbrains for this?

You can set up your C\# project for the Employee Activity Monitor using any of the following IDEs: **Visual Studio**, **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, or **JetBrains Rider**. All three are suitable for C\# and .NET development on Windows, and each has its own strengths:

## Visual Studio

- **Best for:** Full-featured, traditional .NET development, especially for Windows desktop applications.
- **Setup:** Download Visual Studio (Community edition is free), select the ".NET desktop development" workload, and create a new project (e.g., Console App, Windows Service, or Windows Forms, depending on your needs)[^2_6][^2_8].
- **Advantages:** Deep integration with Windows APIs, great debugging tools, easy installer creation, and strong support for background Windows apps.
- **Recommended for:** Most developers, especially if you are new to C\# or want the smoothest experience[^2_3][^2_6][^2_8].


## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

- **Best for:** Lightweight, cross-platform development, or if you prefer a more minimal editor.
- **Setup:**
    - Install VS Code.
    - Install the **C\# Dev Kit** extension from Microsoft.
    - Install the .NET SDK.
    - Use the integrated terminal to run `dotnet new console` (or another template) to create your project[^2_2][^2_3][^2_7].
- **Notes:** VS Code relies on the .NET CLI for project management and building. Debugging and intellisense are good, but some advanced features from Visual Studio are missing[^2_3][^2_5].
- **Recommended for:** Developers who want a fast, customizable editor or are working on less resource-intensive machines.


## JetBrains Rider

- **Best for:** Developers who want a powerful, cross-platform IDE with advanced productivity features.
- **Setup:**
    - Download and install Rider (free trial or paid license).
    - Create a new .NET project through Rider’s UI, or open an existing one.
    - Rider handles .NET SDK and project templates similarly to Visual Studio[^2_4][^2_5].
- **Advantages:** Advanced code analysis, refactoring, and navigation tools. Excellent .NET Core and .NET Framework support. Works well with complex solutions.
- **Recommended for:** Experienced developers or teams already using JetBrains tools, or those who want a more feature-rich alternative to Visual Studio[^2_5].

# which version of .net are we using to build our time tracker? as we will need to interact with windows api right?

For your time tracker application requiring Windows API interaction, the recommended .NET version is **.NET 8 (LTS)** or **.NET 9** (when released), targeting **Windows 10/11 x64**. Here's the technical breakdown:

### Key Implementation Factors

1. **Windows-Specific Requirements**
Your PRD specifies:
    - Windows 10/11 x64 compatibility
    - P/Invoke for `GetForegroundWindow()`, `GetWindowText()`, and global input hooks
    - SQLite integration and HTTP client usage

.NET 8/9 fully supports these requirements while maintaining modern development practices.
2. **Why Not .NET Framework?**
    - **Legacy Limitations**: .NET Framework 4.8.x lacks modern C\# features and performance optimizations
    - **No Cross-Platform Path**: Would lock you into Windows-only deployment
    - **Security Updates Ending**: Mainstream support ended in 2023[^3_5]
3. **Critical NuGet Packages**


| Package | Purpose | .NET Compatibility |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` | Local SQLite database operations | .NET 8/9 |
| `System.Net.Http` | HTTP client for data submission | Built into SDK |
| **CsWin32** (Recommended) | Modern P/Invoke generator | .NET 5+ |
| `PInvoke.Windows.Core` | Legacy P/Invoke helpers | .NET Framework[^3_4] |


### Implementation Strategy

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <UseWindowsForms>true</UseWindowsForms> <!-- If using WinForms -->
  </PropertyGroup>
  
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Data.Sqlite" Version="8.0.4" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Windows.CsWin32" Version="0.3.49-beta" PrivateAssets="all" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```


### Windows API Interaction Best Practices

1. **Use CsWin32 Instead of Legacy P/Invoke**
Generates optimized P/Invoke signatures at build time:

```csharp
using static Windows.Win32.PInvoke; // Auto-generated from Win32 metadata

IntPtr hWnd = GetForegroundWindow();
```

2. **Global Hooks Implementation**
Leverage `SetWindowsHookEx` via CsWin32:

```csharp
using Windows.Win32.UI.WindowsAndMessaging;

HHOOK keyboardHook = SetWindowsHookEx(
    WINDOWS_HOOK_ID.WH_KEYBOARD_LL,
    LowLevelKeyboardProc,
    hMod,
    0
);
```

3. **Target Framework Moniker**
`net8.0-windows` ensures access to Windows-specific APIs while maintaining modern .NET features[^3_5].

### Compatibility Matrix

| Feature | .NET 8/9 | .NET Framework 4.8 |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Windows 11 Support | ✓ | Limited |
| Modern C\# Features | ✓ | Partial |
| P/Invoke Performance | ✓✓ | ✓ |
| Long-Term Support | ✓ (LTS) | ✗ |
| Container Deployment | ✓ | ✗ |

For new Windows-focused applications requiring system-level integration, Microsoft explicitly recommends .NET 8/9 over .NET Framework for its improved performance, security, and modern toolchain[^3_5][^3_6]. The only exception would be if you need to support Windows 7/8.1, which your PRD doesn't require.

dotnet --version
```

You should see the installed version number (e.g., `8.0.108` or `9.0.100`)[^4_3][^4_5][^4_4].

---

## **Notes**

- Installing the SDK also installs the runtime; you do not need to install the runtime separately[^4_5].
- .NET 8 is the current Long-Term Support (LTS) version; .NET 9 is the latest feature release as of 2025[^4_2][^4_3][^4_5].
- You do **not** need Visual Studio to install or use the .NET SDK, but Visual Studio (2022 17.8 or later) is recommended for best integration[^4_3][^4_6].

---

**Summary:**

- Download from the official .NET site and run the installer, or
- Use `winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.9` (or `.8`) in an admin terminal,
- Then verify with `dotnet --version`[^4_2][^4_5][^4_6].

# is there a dotnet sdk manager?

Yes, there are several .NET SDK managers available that help you install, manage, and switch between multiple .NET SDK versions, similar to tools like nvm for Node.js or pyenv for Python.

## Popular .NET SDK Managers

| Tool Name | Platform | Features |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **dver (.NET Version Manager)** | Windows, Linux, macOS | Install, list, switch SDK versions (`use`), check current version, inspired by nvm/sdkman[^5_3]. |
| **Dots** | Windows, macOS | Install, uninstall, switch SDKs, search for SDKs, show metadata, check release notes[^5_6]. |
| **DotNetInstallSdkGlobalTool** | Cross-platform | Installs SDKs based on `global.json`, can install latest preview, works as a .NET global tool[^5_5]. |


---

### Example: Using dver (.NET Version Manager)

- **Install dver:**
Follow instructions on the [dver GitHub page][^5_3].
- **List installed SDKs:**

```
dver list
```

- **Install a new SDK version:**

```
dver install 8.0.100
```

- **Switch to a specific version:**

```
dver use 8.0.100
```

- **Check currently active SDK:**

```
dver current
```


---

### Example: Using Dots

- **Install and run Dots:**
Download from the [Dots GitHub page][^5_6] and follow the instructions.
- **Features:**
Dots provides a user-friendly interface to search, install, uninstall, and switch between .NET SDKs.

---

### Example: DotNetInstallSdkGlobalTool

- **Install the tool globally:**

```
dotnet tool install -g installsdkglobaltool
```

- **Install SDK based on `global.json`:**

```
dotnet-install-sdk
```

- **Install latest preview SDK:**

```
dotnet-install-sdk --latest-preview
```


---

## Summary

- You are not limited to manual installation; you can use tools like **dver**, **Dots**, or the **DotNetInstallSdkGlobalTool** to manage your .NET SDKs efficiently[^5_3][^5_5][^5_6].
- These tools are especially useful if you work on multiple projects that require different SDK versions or want to automate SDK management across your team.

Choose the manager that best fits your workflow and platform.

# how do i initialise my project for my time tracker? i want to set it up in one monolithic repo where i have the desktop app in a folder and another folder for the webserver (future work)

To initialize your time tracker project as a monolithic (monorepo) repository—with a folder for the desktop app and another for the webserver (for future work)—follow these steps:

---

## 1. **Create the Monorepo Structure**

Organize your root directory to clearly separate each component. A recommended structure:

```
/timetracker-monorepo
  /desktop-app      # C# .NET Windows desktop agent
  /webserver        # Django webserver (future)
  /shared           # (Optional) Shared libraries, docs, scripts
  README.md
  .gitignore
```

This makes it easy to manage, build, and scale your project as it grows[^6_3][^6_6].

---

## 2. **Initialize the Git Repository**

From your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
mkdir timetracker-monorepo
cd timetracker-monorepo
git init
```


---

## 3. **Set Up the Desktop App Project**

Navigate to the `desktop-app` folder and create your C\# project targeting .NET 8 or later:

```bash
mkdir desktop-app
cd desktop-app
dotnet new winforms -n TimeTracker.DesktopApp
# or use 'dotnet new console -n TimeTracker.DesktopApp' if you prefer a background console app
```

This creates a solution and project for your Windows agent. You can also use Visual Studio or Rider to create and add the project here[^6_3].

---

## 4. **(Optional) Set Up the Webserver Folder**

Prepare a placeholder for your Django backend:

```bash
mkdir ../webserver
# You can initialize your Django project here in the future
```

This keeps your future backend work organized and separate[^6_1][^6_5].

---

## 5. **Add a Solution File at the Root (Recommended for C\#)**

Back at the root, create a solution file to manage all C\# projects:

```bash
cd ..
dotnet new sln -n timetracker
dotnet sln timetracker.sln add desktop-app/TimeTracker.DesktopApp/TimeTracker.DesktopApp.csproj
```

This allows you to build all your C\# projects from the root solution[^6_3].

---

## 6. **Version Control and Documentation**

- Add a `.gitignore` (use `dotnet new gitignore` or get one from GitHub).
- Add a `README.md` describing the repo structure, setup, and project goals[^6_6].

---

## 7. **Best Practices**

- **Keep dependencies separate** for each project (desktop app and webserver)[^6_4][^6_5].
- **Use clear naming conventions** for folders and projects.
- **Document** the structure and setup instructions in `README.md`.
- **Automate builds/tests** as your repo grows (CI/CD)[^6_6].
- **Add shared libraries** in a `/shared` folder if needed in the future[^6_3][^6_5].

---

## **Example Final Structure**

```
/timetracker-monorepo
  /desktop-app
    /TimeTracker.DesktopApp
      ...C# project files...
  /webserver
    ...future Django project...
  /shared
    ...shared code or docs (optional)...
  timetracker.sln
  README.md
  .gitignore
```


---

This structure will let you develop, test, and maintain both your Windows agent and webserver in a single, well-organized repository—making collaboration, versioning, and future expansion much easier[^6_3][^6_6].
